I actually really enjoyed building this one. JS is starting to make some sense. At times if something didn't quite work as expected (at some point the math was really crazy, it was somehow counting both positive and negative), I'd write things out or draw what I want the DOM to read and what I think is going wrong. I also made lots of notes for myself to not get lost, as the code was getting quite long.

-What requirements did you achieve?
Integrated the API -- used a few functions -- used event listeners -- saved and retrieved data from local storage -- used setInterval for the auto counter -- some UX visual feedback (with the cookie click effect and disabling buttons if unaffordable)

-Were there any requirements or goals that you were unable to achieve?
I was thinking of adding a sound when the user spends the money to buy an upgrade, if I had some more time. I should.

-If so, what was it that you found difficult about these tasks?
Not fully sure about the requirements on using functions. I would like some feedback whether I achieved them close enough.

I'm confused about what the README requirements are about. I did not understand those. I usually use these files to provide assignment reflections.
